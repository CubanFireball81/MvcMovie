# MvcMovie
  ![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

  ## Description 
  This application was created so I could learn ASP.NET Core 6 MVC application creation. This project is a movie
  database that allows users to create, edit, search, filter, and delete movie listings. Overall, I feel really 
  good after building this project as it helped me understand ASP.NET more than just reading and wathcing videos.
